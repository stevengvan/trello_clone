# Trello Clone

A recreation of the popular Kanban board, Trello, using React JS. The project features a drag and drop functionality for cards in the lists and many features to ease organize the Kanban board. This project also supports mobile platforms, although drag and drop functionality was not included and will instead rely on the action menus and dropdown menus to manipulate the items.
